# Suspected_list
Data engineering school task  
- Make a list of suspects (initial in suspects.txt file) based on the following rule: a suspect is a person who called another suspect and the call lasted more than 2 minutes 
- Solve the problem so that the search for suspects is performed several times (forming N circles of suspects, i.e. in file 0 circle, those who called them are the 1st circle, who called suspects of the 1st circle are the 2nd circle, etc.) To do this increase the number of calls to 10-20 thousand and overgenerate 
- Increase the number of calls to hundreds of thousands and complicate the rule for suspects - it takes at least 3 calls of more than 2 minutes to add a caller to the list of suspects.
